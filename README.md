# MOEADpy
***
A Python port of the [MOEADr](https://github.com/fcampelo/MOEADr) package, a modular component-based implementation of the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm with Decomposition (MOEAD/D) framework.

This MOEA/D framework is seen as a combination of specific design decisions regarding several independent modules:

- Decomposition strategy;  
- Aggregation function;  
- Objective scaling strategy;  
- Neighborhood assignment strategy;  
- Variation Stack;  
- Update strategy;  
- Constraint handling method;  
- Termination criteria
